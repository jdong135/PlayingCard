# PlayingCard
HTML/CSS/JS code to generate playing cards

Face card images from: http://www.brainjar.com/css/cards/

Font, colors, and inspiration from: https://codepen.io/jughosta/pen/NqgZOZ

I recreated the codepen with my own HTML/CSS/JS for future use in card game projects. 

Example playing card (A-10):

Example playing card (J-K):
